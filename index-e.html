  <p> The main goal of the network <em>Red Latinoamericana de Teoría de Números</em> is to incentivate and promote the developments of Number Theory among Latin American countries. Starting in 2011, different isolated events with the same final goal have been organized in South American countries, the first one being the <em>Primer Encuentro Regional de Teoría de Números</em>, held in Buenos Aires, together with the first <em>AGRA</em> school in Santiago de Chile in 2012. Since then, we have continue organizing different events, observing how the number theory comunity grew.</p>
  <p>When the pandemic situation hit the world in 2020, some of us decided to make our meetings virtual, creating the <em>LATeN Seminar</em> (see the bar menu for more information), a weekly meeting that consisted of a regular research presentation, and right afterwards, a virtual coffee. The relaxing and friendly environment ended up being very fruitful to promote the interaction between the comunity. Once the pandemic situation was over, we adapted to the new global reality, going back to the traditional dissemination channels, namely the AGRA schools and the Encuentros Regionales de Teoría de Números.</p>
  <p> After different conversasions among schools/workshops participants, we decided that it was the right time to go one step further, and create the current network. Through the network, we expect to convene people interested in organizing Number Theory meetings and contribute by giving visibility to the event. We also expect to weave ties between potential graduate students from countries where this research area is underrepresented, and researchers willing to supervise them.</p>
<h1 id="-1"></h1>
  <p> To fulfill our goals, our web page contains information on different activities thatwill be hoasted in Latin America, and are organized by members of the network (or by other mathematicians who shared the information with us). There are two new and important features: the first one is the list of the network members. It contains different researchers working on number theory (both from Latin America, and from outside Latin America) who are willing to be contacted either while searching for speakers on an event, or for prospective graduate students.</p>
  <p> The second novelty, is that starting on 2025, we will have a <strong>Latin American Colloquium in Number Theory</strong> (more information on the side tab). The Colloquium will take place every first thursday of the month, and after the presentation, we will resume our virtual coffee. Hope to see you there!</p>
